Make SHA256 tokens.
You can use this tool to make CSRF tokens or make some hashes in a different way.
But I do not recommend you to use it as a password storage.

Token maker version 1.

To run tokenmaker tool you need to use python3.

This tool gives you a token after you add a salt code, a password and a key.

Salt definition from wikipedia:

A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase.
